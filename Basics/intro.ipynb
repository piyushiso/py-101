    "### What is Python?\n",
    "Python is a high-level programming language created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It is designed to be easy to read and write, which makes it beginner-friendly while still powerful enough for professionals. Python is widely used in web development, software development, mathematics, data analysis, automation, and system scripting.\n",

    "### What can Python do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose programming language, hence it can do a lot of things, but is mostly popular as it: \n",
    "- Is used to build web applications on servers, \n",
    "- Is used to automate repetitive tasks, \n",
    "- Is used to do work related to databases, and files, \n",
    "- Is heavily used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing because it can handle large datasets and complex calculations,\n",
    "- Is also popular for rapid prototyping, meaning you can quickly test ideas and later turn them into full production software.\n",

    "### History of Python\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and officially released in 1991. It was developed as a successor to the ABC language, with a strong focus on simplicity, readability, and efficiency. The name “Python” does not come from the snake. It was inspired by the British comedy show Monty Python’s Flying Circus. Guido wanted the language name to feel fun, memorable, and non-serious, which also influenced Python’s playful culture and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python was first released, faster and more established languages like C, C++, and Java dominated the industry. Hardware was limited, and interpreted languages were often seen as slow and unsuitable for large systems. As a result, Python stayed mostly within academic and hobbyist communities during its early years, despite being well designed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s popularity surged in the 2000s and 2010s due to the rise of the internet, automation needs, and data-driven industries. Frameworks like Django and Flask boosted web development, while libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow made Python the default choice for data science, AI, and machine learning. Companies valued development speed over low-level performance, and Python fit that shift perfectly. Its massive open-source ecosystem and beginner-friendly nature turned it into one of the most widely used programming languages today.\n",
    "_____\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python is popular?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python works across platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux, and its syntax is close to everyday English, which reduces complexity. It uses indentation instead of brackets to define code structure, making programs cleaner and more readable. Python runs using an interpreter, so code executes immediately without a long compilation step, allowing faster learning and development. Today, Python 3 is the standard version and is commonly written using text editors or IDEs like PyCharm and Thonny for larger projects.\n",
